      <div className={styles.articleContent}>
        <p>
          Today, we are officially launching <strong>Glean</strong>—the first open-source AI agent skill pack designed to turn your local coding agent into a high-performance, undetectable lead generation engine.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a world where platforms like LinkedIn and X (Twitter) have declared war on automation, Glean provides a safe, local-first alternative that doesn't just "automate" outreach—it <em>humanizes</em> it.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem: The "Death" of Outreach Automation</h2>
        <p>
          If you've used traditional LinkedIn or X automation tools recently, you know the risks. Captchas, account restrictions, and "shadowbanning" are the norm. These platforms use sophisticated behavioral analysis to detect the tiny "jitters" and predictable patterns of headless browsers like Selenium or Puppeteer.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution: Glean + BrowserAct</h2>
        <p>
          Glean solves the detectability crisis by using <strong>BrowserAct</strong> under the hood. 
        </p>
        <p>
          BrowserAct is a specialized browser automation CLI that connects to your <em>actual</em> Chrome browser via remote debugging. By leveraging BrowserAct, Glean ensures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>100% Undetectability:</strong> Since the agent uses your real browser profile (with your real cookies, history, and hardware fingerprints), platforms see a human user, not a bot.</li>
          <li><strong>Local-First Data:</strong> Your leads never touch a third-party server. Everything is stored in a local <code>leads.csv</code> on your machine.</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Interaction:</strong> Every click, scroll, and keystroke is randomized by BrowserAct to simulate human hesitation and jitter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Core Capabilities: How Glean Works</h2>
        <p>
          Glean is more than just a search tool; it's a full-lifecycle pipeline manager. Here’s what you can do with it today:
        </p>
        
        <h3>1. Multi-Platform Discovery</h3>
        <p>
          Find prospects exactly where they hang out. Whether it's decision-makers on <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, early adopters posting on <strong>X</strong>, or local businesses on <strong>Google Maps</strong>, Glean extracts the data you need into a unified format.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Hyper-Personalized Outreach</h3>
        <p>
          Using your <strong>Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)</strong>, Glean's AI drafts messages that reference a prospect's specific profile content, recent posts, or company bio. This isn't "mail merge"—it's one-to-one intelligence.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Local Pipeline Management</h3>
        <p>
          Glean tracks every lead through stages: <code>discovered</code>, <code>contacted</code>, <code>replied</code>, and <code>converted</code>. You can ask your agent to "show my pipeline" or "send follow-ups to everyone who replied," and it will handle the heavy lifting.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Launch Your First Campaign</h2>
        <p>
          Getting started with Glean takes less than 2 minutes. Follow these steps to build your undetectable pipeline:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Install:</strong> Run <code>npx skills add pathanaawej0-dot/Glean</code> in your terminal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Setup:</strong> Type <code>"setup glean"</code> in your agent chat. This will configure BrowserAct and help you define your targeting criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Discover:</strong> Say <code>"find 20 founders in SF on LinkedIn"</code>. Watch as BrowserAct opens a tab and gathers data safely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Engage:</strong> Say <code>"send personalized connection requests to the new leads"</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>
          "Glean is built for developers and founders who value privacy, security, and the power of local AI orchestration."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Future of Lead Gen is Local</h2>
        <p>
          The era of expensive SaaS seats and risky cloud automation is ending. With Glean, you own your data, you own your browser, and you own your pipeline.
        </p>
